# Project-Sauboua-Benoit

You can find here in this GitHub some different project I have done during my study.

first :

Small project in arduino, it was an amphibious car. You can find bluetooth connexion and servomotors programs. The project has not been finished. I used Arduino IDE to program it.

Second : 

VideoGame on C. Creation of a Bomberman video game, the purpose of the game is to control the hero of the game and to break some light wall and to kill the ennemies. I used Clion to program it.

Third :

Articulated arm  in C and Arduino. the purpose of this project was to create from nothing an articulated arm in a group of 4 persons. We did the modelisation, the electrical schematic and also the programmation. We used an DSPic33f to control the motor and the distance sensor and we used arduino to control the servomotor. 

Fourht :

IT reporting system using sensor on a machin and sending data on a gateway which feeds a cloud. We use an ESP32 for programming the sensors in C, a Raspberry Pi for the gateway and using flask.
